# Reference

My biggest reference was the AAA game DISHONORED, which uses this system a lot.

# Objective
This functionality was made for my portfolio and to grow my programming skills.

Also, if you want to use this project for study, make money, etc., it's okay! Use it as you wish!

# How was done?

1.0 - Firstly, I've modified the character and created a scene component with two static meshes to be my blink visual reference.

2.0 - After that, I've just made all the logic of visibility and blink ability.
